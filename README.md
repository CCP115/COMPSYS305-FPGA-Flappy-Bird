## Project Brief
The goal of the mini project is to design a simple game console with a built-in computer game using only digital logics and digital design.
Flapy Bird was an extremely popular mobile game, and in this project we attempt to recreate it using only an FPGA and a compatible VGA monitor.

## Project Notes

A group project consisting of three members. Code was written in VHDL and was flashed to an Altera DE0 development board using Quartus.
Some aspects discovered through this project include writing and flashing VHDL, Pin I/O assignment, Resource Management and Utilization, VGA connections, and M9K Memory Block usage.

## Summary

All work was split inbetween three members of the group. Writing the code in VHDL was a fun challenge, and proved to have some advantages and disadvantages. Writing abstract code to make a game can be easier in a higher level language, but writing in VHDL meant we had to consider most entities on a hardware level. This was enjoyable and helped cement a deeper understanding and appreciation of the hardware we take for granted in day to day life.
There were some difficulties in understanding and a fair number of glitches, but we have a playable final product. There is definitely room for improvement, but as usual time limitations proved to be a nuisance. Overall still a project I was proud to help work on.
